# Parameters
- evtGroupRad introduced
- evtMergeRad (formerly maxDist_site_merge_um) (re)implemented to correct an error in parameter usage
- selection of evtDetectRad, evtGroupRad, or evtMergeRad as the parameter of choice has been corrected in some places
- exact usage of nSitesExcl clarified in docs
- nPassesMerge had reported an incorrect default value in the docs; this has been fixed

# JRC
- hCfg is now a hidden attribute but publicly settable
- `compile` command is now (re)implemented
- `auto` is now `recluster`
- steps in pipeline have been broken out into their own functions (run calls each in turn)
- saveRes and saveBinaries are separate functions
- saveRes can be called with a forceOverwrite parameter
- user is warned if spikesRaw, spikesFilt, spikeFeatures are empty on load

# Config
- automatically set to error if rawRecordings is empty

# Recording
- supply a more helpful error message if nSamples is not an integer

# DetectController
- check for error in hRec before trying to detect
- save rawShape, filtShape, featuresShape in detect()

# metaToStruct
- check given .meta file is a text file

# help
- now opens the RTD site or directs user to visit

# Parameters
- ignoreChans (formerly viChanZero) (re)implemented to address issue #83

# Config
- canonical version of ignoreSites was computed wrong in validation; this has been fixed

# CurateController
- "File > Save" menu callback crashed with "Too many input arguments" (see #86); this has been fixed

7 Feb 2019

# Parameters
- a post-validation transform was erroneously applied to `freqLimNotch`; this has been fixed

# planLoad
- on non-Windows systems without GPUs (i.e., where no memory information is available),
  JRCLUST attempts to load the entire file, potentially crashing when the file is large;
  this has been fixed

# doBootstrap
- double check for binary file if binary and meta filenames don't match

# Config
- glob expansion in bin files was resulting in nested cell arrays instead of files; this has been fixed

# jrc
- try-catch around hJRC creation resulting in useless error messages; this has been corrected

6 Feb 2019

Added an importer for JRCv3 _jrc.mat files.
This can be used via `jrc importv3 /path/to/your/session_jrc.mat`

# JRC
- deprecate/warning was giving erroneous messages; this has been fixed

# Config
- make errors and warnings (if in dialogs) blocking
- make fullParams a dependent property rather than recomputing it in different places
- don't validate params if not given a filename in constructor
- removed setters for `*Samp` (dependent) properties
- check for Dependent status and membership in fullParams in setCustomProp
- added pointer to param docs when exporting prm file

# depWarn
- make deprecation warnings blocking

# jrc.json
- added link to documentation
- updated release to alpha-patch2

5 Feb 2019

# Parameters
- `realignTraces` did not have a section field, causing crashes on `Config.save`; this has been fixed
- change sections for various filtering params to "preprocessing" rather than "spike detection"
# TracesController
- spike highlights were not clearing after toggling spikes off; this has been fixed
- annoying "Beginning/End of file" message triggered before reaching BOF/EOF; this has been fixed
# PreviewController
- spike highlights were not clearing after toggling spikes off; this has been fixed
- annoying "Beginning/End of file" message triggered before reaching BOF/EOF; this has been fixed
# Config
- ignoreSites was indexed with ismember(siteMap, ignoreSites), potentially causing OOB errors; this has been fixed
# various
- replace `isfile` with `exist(., 'file') == 2` and `isdir` with `exist(., 'dir') == 7`
- `exist` called without abs path returned false positives, leading to references to nonexistent files; this has been fixed

4 Feb 2019

# Parameters
- `RDDetrendMode`: 'hidehiko' renamed to 'regress'
- `realignTraces` was overlooked; this has been fixed
- old2new parameter mapping moved into params.json
- `deprecated` field (with supported/partially supported subfields) added to params.json
# Config class
- `validateProp` method failed to check default string values because MATLAB is weird about "" strings; this has been fixed
- `save` method exported default params, not user-specified params; this has been fixed
- `oldParamSet` made a dependent property
- added `setCustomProp` method: Config no longer ignores params not found in the default set
- added `deprecatedParams` property: check for deprecated status when calling `setCustomProp`
- added `isV3Import` property: Config will export a new config file if this is true
- `save` method exports custom properties if there are any
# JRC class
- `saveFiles` saved binaries (raw/filtered traces, features) on sort without detect; this has been fixed
